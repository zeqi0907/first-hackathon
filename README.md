## Reflection on challenges and learnings
Since this is our first hackathon for all of the member, we went into this without any prior knowledge or experience. As we started to brainstorm and actually creating the project, we have discover that we still lack the proper skills and knowledge to produce a useable and efficient product. It has also struck us that our critical thinking and problem solving skills still need much improvement. As all of us are also busy with tests and assignments, we have also struggled a lot with meeting internal deadlines and are forced to rush the development of this project last minute. Through this hackathon, we have failed a lot but also learned many lessons in the hard way. All of us have learn and grasp a better understanding of our ability and limitation on our ablilty. We will learn from all the mistakes we have done, continue polish our skills to be able to compete with other competitors in our future hackathon, so that we can be our best version when we eventually enter the workforce
